'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.

def count_th(word):

    # TBC
    # recursive call

    # return
    # what do we return
    # we return a count of string occurrences
    # of "th"

    # base case
    # what do we drive to

    # how would I do this
    # scan through and look for occurrences where
    # word[i] + word[i + 1] = "th"
    # how to keep track of count

    pass
